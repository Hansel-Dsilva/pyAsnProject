# pyAsn1project
A single python program to complete whole assignment.
This is an interesting way of doing the SDL Tut assignment #1.

"SDLasn1.py" is the main script which can execute any #.py code in the same directory, according to user input.
Folder "dist" contains all the .py codes and the Q.txt along with a static standalone windows-executable(.exe) version
of the main script.

To contribute to the code using Github:
Upload your problem solution to "dist" folder as <Problem no.>.py

For example, if you want to contribute a script that solves Problem #10:
Go to the "dist" directory > 
Click on "Upload files" top right > 
Upload your code as 10.py

That's it, the main script will automatically accomodate the new script
and can be used to execute it by entering the correct number, ie 10 in this case.

To try the codes locally, just download the entire "dist" folder and execute "SDLasn1.py"
