# pyAsn1project
A single python program to complete whole assignment.
This is an interesting way of doing the SDL Tut assignment #1.

Folder "dist" contains all the .py codes and the Q.txt along with a static standalone windows-executable(.exe) version
of the main script. "SDLasn1.py" is the main script which can execute any #.py code in the same directory, according to user input. To add your code to the repo, commit your .py file as <Qnumber>.py to 'dist' folder in this repo.
That's it, the main script will automatically accomodate the new script
and can be used to execute it by entering the correct number.

To try the codes locally, just download/clone the entire "dist" folder and execute "SDLasn1.py"

PS: To contribute to the code using Github:

1) Fork the repo to your own account.
2) Clone(download) the repo to your local machine.
3) Create a new "topic branch" and make changes.
4) Push your topic branch to your fork.
5) Create a pull request to this repo.
6) Make any requested changes.
The pull request is then merged (usually into the master branch) and the topic branch is deleted from the upstream (target) repo.
